          <h2>TL;DR</h2>
          <p>We study whether LLMs can evaluate <strong>literary</strong> machine translation (English → Korean) in a <strong>fine-grained</strong> and <strong>interpretable</strong> way. We propose a two-step pipeline:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>RULER</strong>: rubric-based scoring for foundational translation quality (lexical choice, honorifics, syntax/grammar, content accuracy).</li>
            <li><strong>VERSE</strong>: question-answering-based verification of paragraph-specific literary qualities (LLM generates criteria/questions; another LLM checks whether the translation satisfies them).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>LLM judges correlate with humans better than traditional MT metrics, but still fall short of <strong>inter-human agreement</strong>, especially for <strong>Korean honorifics</strong>. We also observe that LLM judges tend to favor translations produced by other LLMs over professional human translations.</p>

          <p class="caption">Figure 1: The overview of our proposed framework: we evaluate translation of literary works in two stages. In the first step, we focus on semantic and linguistic features of the translation using a human-generated rubric. In the second step, we verify how much of the literary qualities have been captured through the translation by two-agent question answering, where one LLM generates a list of criteria and the other LLM verifies whether those criteria have been satisfied.</p>

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            In this work, we propose and test a two-step framework for evaluating literary machine translation, focusing on English to Korean. The framework combines RULER, a rubric-based evaluation tailored to language-specific features, with VERSE, a language-agnostic question–answering module. Our results show that it provides fine-grained, interpretable metrics suited for literary translation and achieves stronger correlation with human judgment than traditional machine translation metrics. However, it still falls short of inter-human agreement, particularly in culturally sensitive areas such as Korean honorifics. We also find that LLMs tend to favor translations produced by other LLMs. These findings highlight both the potential of our framework and the need for culturally aware evaluation methods to ensure accurate and sensitive translation of literary works.

          <div class="kicker">Motivation</div>
          <h2>Why this matters</h2>
          <p>Literary translation evaluation is hard: the “best” translation is not just semantically adequate, but also preserves voice, tone, imagery, interpersonal dynamics, register, and culture-specific choices. Existing metrics (BLEU/BERTScore/COMET) do not capture these well for literary text, and fine-grained human evaluation is expensive.</p>

          <h2>Dataset</h2>
          <p>We curate <strong>15 English short stories with Korean translations</strong>, aligned at the paragraph level:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>725 parallel aligned paragraphs</strong> total (avg 48.3 paragraphs/story).</li>
            <li>Diverse genres and eras (nearly two centuries).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>(See Appendix A/Table 7 in the paper for the story list.)</p>
          <p>Human annotation data used in this work will be made public upon the acceptance of the paper.</p>

          <div class="kicker">Approach</div>
          <h2>Method overview</h2>
          <h3>Step 1: RULER (rubric-based scoring)</h3>
          <p>From qualitative analysis of translation errors, we define 4 foundational criteria and write detailed rubrics (1–5 scale):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lexical choice (idiomatic, fluent word choice)</li>
            <li>Honorifics in dialogues (register/politeness consistency and correctness)</li>
            <li>Syntax &amp; grammar</li>
            <li>Content accuracy</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An LLM judge scores each criterion using the rubric.</p>
          <h3>Step 2: VERSE (question-based verification)</h3>
          <p>Foundational correctness is not enough for literary quality. For each paragraph, an LLM generates a list of <strong>paragraph-specific criteria/questions</strong> informed by the story context. A second model answers those questions by scoring whether the translation satisfies each criterion on a <strong>1–3 scale</strong> (fail/partial/success). We cluster questions into 9 literary categories (e.g., imagery, voice/tone, interpersonal hierarchy, etc.) for interpretability.</p>

          <h2>Key results</h2>
          <h3>Correlation with human judgment (Step 1: RULER)</h3>
          <p>Across the 4 criteria, GPT-4o shows moderate correlation with humans, while still far below inter-human agreement. For example (Kendall’s τ shown; see paper table for full Kendall/Spearman/MSE):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>GPT-4o τ: Honorifics 0.43, Syntax 0.34, Lexical 0.35, Content 0.43</li>
            <li>Human τ: Honorifics 0.76, Syntax 0.58, Lexical 0.69, Content 0.63</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Correlation with human judgment (Step 2: VERSE)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>GPT-4o: Kendall’s τ 0.29, Spearman 0.39, MSE 0.23</li>
            <li>Human: Kendall’s τ 0.53, Spearman 0.69, MSE 0.35</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>A notable failure mode: LLMs prefer LLM translations</h3>
          <p>When scoring whole-story translations, the judge assigns very high scores to strong LLM translations and often ranks them above professional human translations. Controlled A/B checks show humans still prefer the professional translations in most cases, suggesting a judge bias toward “literal/LLM-like” surface features.</p>

          <h2>Limitations and Pitfalls</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The biggest limitation of our study is that it is only limited only one language pair (English to Korean). However, much of the pipeline can be modified easily for other languages easily.</li>
            <li>Even the strongest evaluator tested fails to match inter-human agreement. The gap is systematic, not just noise, indicating fundamental limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge approaches for literary quality.
              <ul>
                <li>LLM judges tend to assign higher scores than humans and have difficulty distinguishing very good translations from truly excellent ones.</li>
                <li>The evaluator often prefers translations produced by LLMs over professional human translations, even in cases where human annotators strongly favor the human version. This suggests a bias toward “LLM-like” surface characteristics.</li>
