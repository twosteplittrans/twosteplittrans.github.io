### Lexical Choices 
Proper use of idiomatic expressions and general word choices that demonstrate fluency in the target language

    Rubric:
    5: The translated text chooses words in the target language that best suit the authorial intention of the original text, conveying meaning in a properly idiomatic and fluent manner. The translated text thereby provides readers with an equivalent reading experience and emotional impact when compared with the original text.

    4: The translated text mostly selects appropriate words that match the authorial intention, maintaining idiomatic expressions and fluency in the target language. The translated text generally preserves the reading experience and emotional effect of the original text.

    3: The translated text makes some less accurate or awkward word choices that compromise idiomatic fluency while demonstrating good comprehension of the original text. Lexical choices in the translation somewhat negatively affect readers’ experience and emotional engagement with the text.

    2: The translated text includes multiple inappropriate word choices that compromise idiomatic fluency to the extent that it makes it difficult to understand the authorial intention of the original text. Lexical choices in the translation somewhat negatively affect the reading experience and emotional engagement.

    1: Translated text makes clearly awkward word choices that reveal a critical lack of understanding of idiomatic and natural expressions in the target language, seriously hindering readers’ comprehension and engagement with the text. Lexical choices in the translation reflects critical miscomprehension of the authorial intent of the original text.

    Additional Notes: 
    A lexical choice score of 4 is given when there are some awkward words (up to 3) in the translation, but the original meaning can be accurately captured. A lexical choice score of 3 is awarded when the translation contains a word (up to one) that misinterprets the original meaning but does not detract from the overall meaning.

    When evaluating lexical choices, phonetically writing an English word in Korean (팬트리>pantry) does not count as an error. However, it can be counted as an error if it hinders the reading experience because it is uncommon/awkward.


### Proper Use of Honorifics in Dialogues 
Selection of verb endings that accurately reflects the status of and relationships among the participants in a conversation, resulting in natural-sounding dialogue in the Korean language
       
    Rubric:
    5: The translated text properly captures the relationship between the speaker and the listener(s) of the conversation. The translated text also accurately reflects the culturally and historically specific elements such as titles and modes of appellations. The level of politeness aligns appropriately with the situational context, familiarity, and character.

    4: The translated text mostly captures the relationship between the speaker and the listener(s) of the conversation, with minor inaccuracies in culturally and historically specific elements such as titles and modes of appellations. The level of politeness mostly aligns with the situational context and social status of characters. There may be minor inconsistencies but the dialogue accurately represents the characters’ familiarity and relationships.

    3: The translated text somewhat captures the relationship between the speaker and the listener(s). But the translated text includes noticeable errors in culturally and historically specific elements such as titles and modes of appellations. The level of politeness partially aligns with the situational context and the social status of or relationships of the characters. There are some inconsistencies or awkwardness in the dialogue that are noticeable for native speakers of Korean.

    2: The translated text barely captures the relationship between the speaker and the listener(s). The translated text demonstrates significant misunderstandings of culturally and historically specific elements such as titles and modes of appellations. The level of politeness barely aligns with the situational context, leading to a misrepresentation of the characters’ relationships and awkwardness in the target language.

    1: The translated text completely misunderstands the relationship between the speaker and the listener(s) of the conversation and fails to reflect cultural and historical specificity of the context. The level of politeness in the used language fails to align with the situational context. Inconsistencies or misinterpretations of the appropriate degree of formality significantly undermine the dialogue’s naturalness in Korean.

    Additional Notes: 
    If there are no sentences in the paragraph that can be evaluated using the Honorifics criteria, then the score is 5.
    If the use of honorifics is a translator's choice, it can be given high scores even if it is not the same as human translation.

 
### Syntax & Grammar 
Grammatical accuracy of sentences including proper translation of embedded clauses, conjunctions, sentence connectors, internal logic of sentences, and punctuations, which ultimately makes the translation read naturally in the target language

    Rubric:
    5: The translated text accurately conveys the meaning, logic, and nuances of the original text. Embedded clauses, conjunctions, and sentence connectors are translated meticulously so that the translation reads naturally in the target language without awkward or confusing sentence structures. The number of sentences in the translated text may vary from the number of sentences in the original text if it enhances the naturalness and readability of the translation.

    4: The translated text generally preserves the meaning, logic, and nuances of the original text. The translation of embedded clauses, conjunctions, and sentence connectors reads naturally, with only minor instances of awkwardness or ambiguity. Variations in the number of sentences mostly contribute to the naturalness and readability of the translation.

    3: The translated text partially preserves the meaning, logic, and nuances of the original text. Some embedded clauses, conjunctions, and sentence connectors are translated inaccurately, resulting in awkward sentence structures in the target language. The number of sentences in the translation varies from the number of sentences in the original text without a clear demonstration of the enhancement in readability and naturalness.

    2: The translated text falls short of maintaining the meaning, logic, and nuances of the original text. The translation includes partial but critical mistranslation that makes it difficult to convey the meaning of the original. Many embedded clauses, conjunctions, and sentence connectors are translated inaccurately, which results in awkward and unnatural sentence structures in the target language. Variations in the number of sentences negatively affect the readability and comprehension of the translation.

    1: The translation completely fails to convey the meaning of the entire paragraph. The translated text demonstrates a significant misinterpretation of the original text due to a critical misunderstanding of the internal logic of its complex sentences. Embedded clauses, conjunctions, and sentence connectors are inaccurately translated, resulting in unnatural and awkward sentence structures in the target language. The translated text unnecessarily alters the number of sentences so that the overall comprehensibility and accuracy of the translation is critically compromised.

    Additional Notes: 
    Syntax and Grammar are separate from words and are scored based on whether the sentence form or structure is appropriate to capture meaning. For example, if the words are all translated correctly, but the sentence form and structure make it difficult to understand the meaning, a low score is given. In contrast, a high score is given if the sentence structure and grammar are appropriate, even if the words are not.


 
### Content Accuracy 
Preservation of the meaning of the text, with particular attention to the proper and comprehensive translation of various literary expressions from the original text. Proper translation might involve some additions and omissions, but it should refrain from adding or omitting substantial words or phrases that constitute the content and context of the original text.

    Rubric:
    5: The translated text fully preserves the essential meaning of the original text, demonstrating thorough comprehension of the literary text. There may be additions or omissions of particular words in the translation, but these choices are made only when they significantly enhance content accuracy in translation. On the level of meaning and literary comprehension, none of the words or phrases in the original should be missing or misinterpreted in the translation.

    4: The translated text largely preserves the essential meaning of the original text, reflecting a good overall literary comprehension. There may be some minor omissions or additions of words or expressions, but these do not significantly alter the content and context of the original text. 

    3: The translated text partially preserves the essential meaning of the original text, indicating some, if not critical, miscomprehension of the original text. There are some omissions or unnecessary additions of words or expressions, which somewhat alter the content and context of the original text.

    2: The translated text barely maintains the essential meaning of the original text due to omissions or inaccurate additions of words or phrases that reflect some literary misinterpretation. The translated text misinterprets some of words or idiomatic expressions in the original text, reflecting a significant misunderstanding of the literary work.

    1: The translated text fails to convey the essential meaning of the original text due to critical omissions or inaccurate additions, revealing a fundamental lack of literary comprehension of the original text. Meaningful words or phrases in the original are either missing or replaced with expressions that do not accurately capture the content and context of the original text.

    Additional Notes: 
    Content Accuracy is linked to the broader scope of accuracy and looks mainly at whether anything is missing/added in the translation. If nothing is missing/added, then evaluate how well the translation conveys the overall flow of the original, leaving out the details.
