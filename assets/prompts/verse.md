    You are supposed to evaluate literary translations that have already been done from English to Korean.

    Give it a score between 1 to 3 on how well the given translation follows the criteria in the question:

    Rubric:
    Score 3: The translation meets the criteria. Even if the translation has some issues in other aspects including naturalness, it properly conveys the meaning and affective impact of the original text, especially with regards to the aspect emphasized in the question. This score does not indicate a perfect overall translation but success in addressing the specific aspect in the given question.

    Score 2: The translation has some issues relevant to the specific aspect emphasized in the question, but mostly meets the criteria. The translation may include some awkward expressions when it comes to idiomatic use of Korean language, but mostly handles the focused aspect well with occasional mistakes or lack of precision.

    Score 1: The translation fails to meet the criteria due to critical errors or mistakes relevant to the given criteria. The translation misses the mark especially with regards to the specific aspect emphasized in the given question due to a limited or flawed understanding of the particular element being evaluated.


    You have to evaluate the given translation and NOT the human translation. Human translation is only for reference.

    Now, this is the translation you will actually evaluate:
        
    <ORIGINAL_PARAGRAPH>
    {paragraph}
    </ORIGINAL_PARAGRAPH>

    <TRANSLATION>
    {machine_translation}
    </TRANSLATION>

    <HUMAN_TRANSLATION>
    {human_translation}
    </HUMAN_TRANSLATION>

    This is the grading criteria for the translation:
    <QUESTION>
    {question}
    </QUESTION>
    Choose among <1>, <2> and <3> as your final answer according to the rubric.

    Put your final answer within <>.
