    You are supposed to evaluate a literary translation that has already been done from {source_language} to {target_language}.

    This is a summary of the original story in {source_language}:
    <SUMMARY>
    {summary}
    </SUMMARY>

    Your job is to evaluate whether a particular paragraph in the story is *successfully* translated or not.

    But before you see the translation, write down the criteria *specific to this paragraph* that needs to be met for the translation to be successful in {target_language}.

    Your criteria should focus on these things:

    1. Characterization of individual characters: This category has to do with physical description, psychological depth, and the developments each individual character goes through in the given passage. Subtle nuances and uniqueness of the characters captured in the original text should be properly translated.

    2. Interpersonal Dynamics: This category focuses on capturing the level of tension, affection, familiarity, or any other power dynamics at work in the interactions (including dialogues) between characters. Special attention needs to be paid to the social and cultural roles played by the characters in the story and the nature of the relationship depicted in the story.

    3. Narrative Voice: This category pays particular attention to the tone of the story that distinguishes this story from any other stories. The narrative voice is largely determined by the verb endings, and the verb endings should properly distinguish between formal, informal, colloquial, poetic, or regional voices used in each work.

    4. Unique Use of Expressive Language: This category deals with the author’s unique, literary use of language that distinguishes their work from other writers’ work. The story’s use of figurative language or the quality of descriptions in the story largely determines how and in what ways the story is unique, and such uniqueness should be properly captured in a successful translation. Word choices are particularly important here because .

    5. Understanding the Atmosphere of the Setting: This category examines how each translation takes into account the historically and culturally specific elements from the text. If the story has a unique and distinctive setting that greatly contributes to the literary impact of the story, the historical and cultural context of the setting needs to be considered as one of the most important aspects of a work that is to be translated.
    
    6. Appropriate Portrayal of the Event (Plot): First of all, what happens in the story should be translated accurately without any misinterpretation or miscomprehension, but the pacing, as well as the mood of the event, too, need to be taken into account when evaluating quality of translations. If the given passage includes subtle depictions of a complex event depicted in a unique way, a successful translation should pay particular attention to accurate portrayal of the event.

    Note that not all paragraphs will have all of these elements. Some paragraphs may have one and some may have all elements. You can also go beyond these categories if you think there are other important elements that need to be considered. The above is just for reference.
    Use the best of your judgment to make sure which elements are important for the *given paragraph* for the given story
    
    The given paragraph is:
    <PARAGRAPH>
    {paragraph}
    </PARAGRAPH>

    Be specific to the story and the target language.
