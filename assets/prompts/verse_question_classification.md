    You are given a list of questions that is used to evaluate literary translations. 

    Your job is to classify those questions into one of these categories:

    categories = ["Historical and Cultural Context",
        "Imagery and Descriptive Quality",
        "Character Voice, Tone, and Individuality",
        "Interpersonal Communication and Hierarchy",
        "Linguistic and Idiomatic Naturalness",
        "Nuanced Interpretation including Subtle Implications",
        "Narrative Pacing and Rhythm",
        "Affective and Stylistic Resonance",
        "Overall Consistency and Cohesion"
        ]

    One question belongs to ONLY one category.

    The question list is:

    <Question List> 

    {question_list}

    </Question List>

    Return the category for each question as a list. DO NOT return anything else. ONLY the list. DO NOT return triple quotes. ONLY the list.
